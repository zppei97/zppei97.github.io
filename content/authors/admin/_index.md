#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

üëãüèº Hi, there! I am Zhipeng Pei.

I grew up in Jiaozuo, Henan, China, before embarking on my journey at Wuhan University, where I completed my bachelor's degree in computer science (June 2019). I‚Äôm a third year Ph.D. student at Wuhan University under the supervisions of Profs. [Wei Gong](https://www.whu.edu.cn/info/1545/164954.htm) and [Ge Han](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/hange/zh_CN/index.htm). Currently I am visiting student under the supervision of [Luis Guanter](http://luiguapa.webs.upv.es/) at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Val√®ncia.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I am passionate about helping us better understand the Earth's GHG (especially for carbon dioxide and methane) concentrations and emissions using satellite remote sensing, including IPDA lidar system (active RS) and imaging spectroscopy (passive RS). My goal is to realize independent evaluation of bottom-up inventories via atmospheric transport modeling and space-based observations.
